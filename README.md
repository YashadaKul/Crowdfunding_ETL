# Crowdfunding Challenge

## Background
This repository is the product of one of the group projects completed for the Monash University Data Analytics Bootcamp, Feb 2024 cohort. It tests our skills in the Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) process. This repo contains the following:
1. a Resources folder
2. an Output folder
3. an ipynb file
4. a .png file with an ERD 
5. a .pdf file with ERD data 
6. an sql file with schemas

We have used ETL methods to work on the data provided. We have then prepared schemas in sql and created ERDs with the output from the ETL methods.

## Overview

* Design a query to calculate the total number of stations in the dataset.
* Design a query to find the most-active stations (that is, the stations that have the most rows).
* Design a query to get the previous 12 months of temperature observation (TOBS) data.
* design a Flask API based on the queries

## Usage

To run the Jupyter Note file, follow these general steps:

1. Open the folder where you have stored this repo locally
2. Open Jupyterlab from your terminal from that folder
2. Open the file ETL_Mini_Project_snguyen_mpeck_eharun_ykulkarni.ipynb and run each cell

To run the sql file, follow these general steps:
1. Open the file named crowdfunding_db_schema where you run sql queries, like postgres/pgAdmin
2. Run each query 

To view the ERD, open the .png image file named QuickDBD-ERD Diagram in any app you use to view images. To view more information on the ERD, open the .pdf file titled ERD Diagram.pdf

The Resources folder contains the files to be imported for the analysis, while the Output folder contains the .csv files created as a result of the analysis.
